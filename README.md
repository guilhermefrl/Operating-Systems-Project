# Operating-Systems-Project

## Project objectives

The objective of this project was to create a program that simulates the operation of process management and execution operations.


The program must simulate CPU scheduling and memory management operations (process creation and termination, context switching, memory reservation and release). To allow the user to intervene and perform all the operations that the program offers, processes are expected to execute a defined time of N units.

The program is intended to work with the FCFS, PRIORTY and SJFS scheduling algorithms and the "first fit", "next fit", "best fit", and "worst fit" memory management algorithms.

## Usage

Compile the project using the command `make`.
